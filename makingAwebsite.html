                            <p style="text-align: center">The first thing I did was downloading brackets and selecting a html templete that I liked. I got the templete from <a href="https://html5up.net/prologue">htmlup</a>, I used a templete called prologue. The next thing I did was watching few youtube videos because I needed to learn about the basics in html codeing. I began by watching the youtube videos that my teacher placed on the canvas page of the course. After that I began working on they website. The first thing I did was swapping out the blank images that came with the templete with more personal photos and also images that I liked from google. Here you can view the first html tutorial video I watched: 
                        
                        
                        
                        <center>
            
                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUZUzCrjMzY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
                                
                <p style="text-align: center"> I wrote some text about me and uploaded my c.v. on the website using information that I got from stack-owerflow. I also linked my facebook, twitter and github accounts to the website. I created a new file so I could code this page. Here you can see a part of that code:</p>
                            
                            
                              <center><img src="images/code.JPG" height="450" width="" alt="" /></center>   
                           
                <p style="text-align: center"> After that I made a new repository called "vefsida" on github and uploaded the files that made up my website, here is the  <a href="https://github.com/MagnusRikardsson/vefsida">link</a> to my repository. I used the <a href="https://desktop.github.com"> github desktop app</a> to transfer the files to the website. I then went to settings and found the link to my website under GitHub Pages that is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages from a GitHub repository. Now I will go into a step by step guide how I used the desktop app to push the changes on website.</p>
                
                    
                <p style="text-align: center">Step 1: Make changes to the code in brackets</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">Step 2: Open the desktop app</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">Step 3: Write a summary and click on "commit to main"</p>
                <center><img src="images/commit.JPG" height="450" width="" alt="" /></center> <br />  
                <p style="text-align: center">Step 4: Push the changes by clicking the "Push origin" button that appears.</p>
                <center><img src="images/push.JPG" height="" width="" alt="" /></center>               
                             

                            
                         </div>

                            <p style="text-align: center">The first thing I did was downloading brackets and selecting a html templete that I liked. I got the templete from <a href="https://html5up.net">htmlup.</a> The next thing I did was watching few youtube videos because I needed to learn about the basics in html codeing. I began by watching the youtube videos that my teacher placed on the canvas page of the course. After that I began working on they website. The first thing I did was swapping out the blank images that came with the templete with more personal photos and also images that I liked from google. Here you can view the first html tutorial video I watched:
                        
                        
                        
                        <center>
            
                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUZUzCrjMzY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
                                
                            <p style="text-align: center"> I wrote some text about me and uploaded my c.v. om the website using information that I got from stack-owerflow. I also linked my facebook, twitter and github accounts to the website. I created a new file so I could code this page. Here you can see a part of that code:
                            
                            <a class="image featured"><img src="images/code.JPG" height="550" width="450" alt="" /></a>
                                
                            After that I made a new repository called "vefsida" on github and uploaded the files that made up my website. I used the github desktop app to transfer the files to the website. I then went to settings and found the link to my website under GitHub Pages that is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages from a GitHub repository. Here you can see couple of pictures from my github page:
                                
                            <a class="image featured"><img src="images/Github.JPG" height="550" width="450" alt="" /></a>
                            <a class="image featured"><img src="images/syn.JPG" height="550" width="450" alt="" /></a>
                                

                            
                         </div>

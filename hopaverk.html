                 <p style="text-align: center">A part of the final project is to document my contribution to the group. My groupmembers are Hrannar Þórarinsson, <a href="https://hrannarth.github.io/">his website</a> and Stefán Már Helgason, <a href="https://stefanmar96.github.io/index.html">his website</a>. We divided the following team roles when we started to discuss the project.</p> 
                
                
                <center><img src="images/roles.png" height="" width="" alt="" /></center>
                
                
                <p style="text-align: center">Even though my main role was filming and putting a video together, and creating the presentation, I also supported Hrannar in the design part of the object.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">The filming took part in Fablab Reykjavik when we used the milling machine to cut out our design, which had been drawn in Fusion 360. I recorded around 40 minutes of material that composed of brief clips from all the process. I had to choose the best clips and speed them up because the video was not supposed to be longer than 2 minutes.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: center">I began editing the video in imovie because I have an iphone and I used the camera on my phone to record. After a short time I realised that working on my phone was not the best idea to get the finshed material that I desired. So, I uploaded the video clips to my computer and opened them with Windows video editor, a built in application. Here below you can see how the application environment is set up.</p> 
                
                
                <center><img src="images/video.JPG" height="450" width="850" alt="" /></center><br />
                
                <p style="text-align: center">I did not have much experience in editing videos and this was my first time using the application, but it only took couple of hours to get the hang of it. I trimmed the best clips of the process, sped them up and arranged in appropriate time order. 
                
                <p style="text-align: center">Now I had a decent video, just under 2 minutes in length, and all it needed was a background track instead of the noice from the milling machine. I searched for a free background track for almost an hour and found nothing that I liked so I made the decision of making a short track in Garageband, that took around 4 hours. Here you can listen to the track I made: </p> <center><audio controls><source src="images/Dack.m4a" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></center>
                
                <p style="text-align: center">Now the introduction video was finshed and you can watch the final product here: <center>
                                <video width="900" height="" controls>
                                <source src="images/fixfix.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                                </video>
                                </center></p>
                 
                <p style="text-align: center"> I was also in charge of making a powerpoint presentation to promote our project, <a href="https://stefanmar96.github.io/powerpoint_kynning.html">here</a> can you view the presentation. The presentation is also available on the team website. After that was finished we got information that there would be no "live" presentation, so we had to add to the older video the sales promotion. I also added some extra footage and edited the video to make it better. You can watch the finshed product on the <a href="https://stefanmar96.github.io/project-final.html">team website</a>.
